			// control register (FCR at offset 2).

			// If we cared about the divisor, the code below would set the divisor
			// from a global clock rate of 22.729 MHz (22,729,000 cycles per second)
			// to a signaling rate of 2400 (BAUD). We usually have much faster signalling
			// rates nowadays, but this demonstrates what the divisor actually does.
			// The formula given in the NS16500A specification for calculating the divisor
			// is:
			// divisor = ceil( (clock_hz) / (baud_sps x 16) )
			// So, we substitute our values and get:
			// divisor = ceil( 22_729_000 / (2400 x 16) )
			// divisor = ceil( 22_729_000 / 38_400 )
			// divisor = ceil( 591.901 ) = 592

			// The divisor register is two bytes (16 bits), so we need to split the value
			// 592 into two bytes. Typically, we would calculate this based on measuring
			// the clock rate, but again, for our purposes [qemu], this doesn't really do
			// anything.

			// Notice that the divisor register DLL (divisor latch least) and DLM (divisor latch most)
			// have the same base address as the receiver/transmitter and the interrupt enable register.
			// To change what the base address points to, we open the "divisor latch" by writing 1 into
			// the Divisor Latch Access Bit (DLAB), which is bit index 7 of the Line Control Register (LCR)
			// which is at base_address + 3.
			let lcr = ptr.add(3).read_volatile();
			ptr.add(3).write_volatile(lcr | 1 << 7);

			// Now, base addresses 0 and 1 point to DLL and DLM, respectively.
			// Put the lower 8 bits of the divisor into DLL
			ptr.add(0).write_volatile(divisor_least);
			ptr.add(1).write_volatile(divisor_most);

			// Now that we've written the divisor, we never have to touch this again. In hardware, this
			// will divide the global clock (22.729 MHz) into one suitable for 2,400 signals per second.
			// So, to once again get access to the RBR/THR/IER registers, we need to close the DLAB bit
			// by clearing it to 0. Here, we just restore the original value of lcr.
